# TheaterSimulation

This is a module used to explore the simpy library in Python.
The simulation takes a user input and runs a simulation for SIM_TIME minutes. The result of the simulation is a
calculation of the average wait time experienced by the moviegoer during the simulation

The user can experiment with various resource sizes to discover the optimal configuration
Inputs accepted are as follows:

- Number of ticket cashiers
- Number of food servers
- Number of ushers (for checking tickets)

Output messages are supplied to mark events and to display average wait time calculation result
